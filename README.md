## Game Rules

### Objective

The objective of the Battleship Game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. Each player has a fleet of five different-sized ships: Carrier (5 cells), Battleship (4 cells), Destructor (3 cells), Submarine (3 cells), and Patrol Boat (2 cells).

### Game Setup

- The game board consists of two grids: one for each player - Player and Computer.
- Players take turns to guess the coordinates of their opponent's ships on the opponent's grid.
- The game starts with the Player placing their ships on their own grid. The Computer's ships are placed randomly.

### Gameplay

- Players take turns firing shots at their opponent's grid by selecting a cell on the grid.
- If a shot hits an enemy ship, it's marked as a "hit."
- If a shot misses all enemy ships, it's marked as a "miss."
- The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

### Ship Placement

- The Player can manually place their ships on their grid at the start of the game.
- Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically on the grid, as long as they fit within the boundaries and don't overlap.
- Use the "Change Direction" button to switch between horizontal and vertical placement.

### Winning the Game

- The game continues until one player sinks all of their opponent's ships.
- When all ships of a player are sunk, the opposing player is declared the winner.
